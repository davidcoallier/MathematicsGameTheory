   \title[Battle of the Sexes]{}

   \begin{abstract}
    Consider you and your wife are trying to decide what to do
    this coming Friday night. Your wife wants to go to the movies
    and you want to go to club.

    The \textbf{Battle of the Sexes} game tries to identify the payoff matrix
    for each members of the game. Obviously the respective payoffs are 
    conditional depending on the choice of the other player (In this case
    the husband or wife) involved in the game.
